# 2FA Codes

2FA codes is a Connect IQ widget that generates Time-based one-time passwords used for 2-factor authentication. It is compatible with Google Authenticator and other similar systems.

## Usage


If your device supports glances then you'll get the widget in your glance list in one of the two forms
depicted in the pictures below.

If the devices is powerful enough to support live updates you'll see the code for the last account you
opened and shrinking progress bar showing you how soon the code will change.

If live updates are not supported (or you have not configured any accounts yet) you'll see just the name
of the widget. 

Activating the glance (with a tap and/or select button) will open the full widget. If your device doesn't support glances you will see the full widget in the list of widgets.

If there are more than one account configured you'll see dots indicating the active one on the left side of the screen.

Flick the screen or use up/down buttons to scroll through the accounts. You can use tap or select button to go through the accounts as well. If your device doesn't support glances, you will have to use select button/tap, as up/down buttons will scroll through the widgets.
